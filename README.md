# Policy recommendation

## Description
This project is currently under development. Its goal is to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model to provide personalized policy recommendations and customer support by leveraging enhanced datasets, efficient retrieval systems, and fine-tuned generative AI models.

## Current Status
- ðŸš§ **Work in Progress**: Expect frequent updates and changes.
- Basic structure is being built.
- Key features and documentation will be added soon.

## Planned Features

- Dataset enhancement with historical claims, customer feedback, and competitor data.
 - Comprehensive data preprocessing (standardization, encoding, anonymization).
- Document store setup with vector databases (e.g., Pinecone, FAISS) for efficient retrieval.
- Fine-tuning generative models (e.g., GPT-4, T5) for personalized recommendations.
- Implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for context-based responses.
- Testing, validation, and performance optimization of the pipeline.
- Deployment and continuous monitoring in production.
